Populations and Samples

Definitions:
	A population is a collection of units
	A sample is the subset of the population
	A characteristic/variable of interest is something we want to measure for each unit
Problem:
	spose the city of boulder wants to estuimate its per-household income via a phone survey. They call every 50th number on a list of boulder phone numbers between 6pm and 8pm
		*population: all of boulder residents
		*sample: every 50th person on the phone list that picks up
		*variable of interest: per household income

Sample types:
	* Simple random sample: randomly select people from sample frame
	* Systematic sample: order the sample frame. Choose int k. Sample every kth unit in the sample frame
	* Census sample: sample literally everyone/everythign in the population
	* Stratified sample: if you have a heterogeneous population that can be broken up into homogeneous groups, randomly sample from each group proportionate to their prevalence in the population
		Middle school: 6th, 7th, 8th grade
		sample voi: height
		population: 6th: 100; 7th: 60; 8th: 40
		stratified samp: 10% of each subgroup -> 6th: 10; 7th: 6; 8th: 4

* Data scientist hope to learn about some chacteristic/variable of a population but they usually cant see/study the whole population, so they take a sample and infer from the sample
* so how do they make the jump from studying a simple to drawing meaningful conclusions? Inference
Two types of data exploration:
	* numerical
	* graphical

Summarizing the center, "central tendency" of the sample data is a popular and important characteristic of a set of numbers
	3 measures:
		* mean, also called arithmetic average x-
			* advantages: fast to calculate
			* disadvantages: outliers can make intepretation misleading
		* median x~
			* ordering the observations from lowest to highest, and then find the middle
			* if n is odd: x~ = (n + 1)^th/2
			* if n is even: x~ = (n)^th/2
			* 36 15 39 41 40 42 47 49 7 6
				- First thing to do is sort them:
				- 6 7 15 36 39 40 41 42 47 49
				- n=10
				- median = avg of 5th and 6th datapoint
				- x~=(30+40)/2 = 39.5
				- latex: x~ = \tilde{x}
		* mode x*:
			* the sample mode is the value that occuers most often
Mean vs Median
	* The population mena and median will generally not be equal. If the population distributuion is positively or negative skewed			
	* negative skew (left-skew): the hump is on the right
	* symmetric: highs and lows are canceling eachother out
	* positive skew (right-skew): the hump is on the left dragging the mean up

Quartiles: divide the data into 4 equal parts:
	* lower quartile (Q1 or P25): splits the lowest 25% of the data from the other 75%
	* middle quartile (Q2 or P50): splits the data in half (the median)
	* upper quartile (Q2 or P50): splits the highest 25% from the lowest 75%
	example: 6 7 15 36 39 40 41 42 43 47 49
		- n = 11 -> odd so x~ = Q2 = 40
		- Q1 take the lower half of the data including x~ 6 7 15 36 39 40 = 25.5
		- Q3 is goign to be the upper half of the data including x~ 40 41 42 43 47 49
