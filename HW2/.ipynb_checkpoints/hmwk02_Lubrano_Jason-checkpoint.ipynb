Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "Sonic and Amy are two average hedgehogs who have to run around campus every day for classes and hobbies. When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",

    "* When Sonic and/or Amy is leaving one location, they randomly select one of the available adjacent locations, with equal probability.\n",
    "* This includes back-tracking, but note that to return to their original location would require 2 moves.\n",
    "* Assume that all moves require the same amount of time.\n",
    "* They are also not allowed to stay put; they always must move to some *other* adjacent location.\n",
    "* Sonic and Amy also act **independently** of one another. That is, the probability that Sonic goes from one place to another is independent of Amy's movements.\n",

    "##### Dictionaries\n",
    "I started off unsure if I should make nodes and create a path following algorithm or if I should try another method. Due to my experience in python, or lack thereof, I decided to use dictionaries. It is self explainatory, but I will go through two examples. Starting with `mtns`, there are `places` and `probs`. Respectively, the places and probs are based on the graph. `mtns` can only hit the `hill`. Therefore, the probs of going to `hill` is $1$. From the `hill` the two hedgehogs can go to `mtns`, `gyms`, and `libr`. Therefore, there is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability to going to each of them. The same pattern continues throughout the rest of the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proving B.1\n",
    "B.1 asks what is the probability of the two hedgehogs meeting up given one is at the gym and one is at the engineering center. This is an interesting question because they can only meet up at the library. The function says that the two hedgehogs makes an array of there next location with size `n_trials`, having a probability of `probs`, which is taken from the array. When they meet, a counter adds 1 and then the running average is calculated into an array. I did this so I can test a chart or graph and ensure that my math was correct. Finally the returning value is the last element of the average array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proving B.2\n",
    "What I did here was to go from one location to another, but in a way that is \"hard-coded\". In other words, I am not entirely experienced in python and I dont know how to make one dictionary return another one. So I had to find out where they went after their first move, then move them once more. This is where `travel_two_spots` calls `travel_one_spot`, a helper function that returns the next location. I have a second array for each hedgehog called `amy2` and `sanc2` for this reason. I want to compare their second location, not the first. So I do such, taking a counter, then finding the average. "
