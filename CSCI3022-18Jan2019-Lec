Interquartile range
	* the interquartile range is defined to be the difference between the upper and lower quartiles.
		* Q3 - Q1
	* IQR gives the spread of 50% of the data
	* ex: Use the IQR of the data 6 7 15 36 39 40 41 42 43 47 49
		x~ = Q2 = 40
		Q1 = 25.5
		Q3 = 42.5
		IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 42.5 - 25.5 = 17

John Tukey, father of modern EDA, advocated summarizing data with 5 values
	* min value
	* lower quartile
	* median
	* upper quartile
	* max value
	Ex: find the 5-number summary for 6 7 15 36 39 40 41 42 43 47 49
		n = is odd, Q2 = 40
		min = 6
		max = 49
		Q1 = (15 + 36) / 2 = 25.5
		Q3 = (42 + 43) / 2 = 42.5
	Advantages:
		* gives the center of the data
		* gives the spread of the data
		* gives the skewness of the data
			- if Q2 is closer to Q1 than Q3 then you know median is "leaning left" i.e right-skewed
			- if Q2 is closer to Q3 than Q1, then median is "right leaning" i.e left-skewed

Graphical summaries through different plots

Histograms
	* a histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical dat
	* limp or "bin" the observed values of the VOI
		* Bins typically consecutive, non-overlapping and equal in length
	* Frequency histogram: count the number of data values that fall inot a bin and draw a rectangle over that bin with height equal to the count
	* Density histogram: count the number of data values that fall into a bin and adjust the height such that the sum of theearea of all bins is equal to 1
	* consider where the bins begin/end
	Ex: Find the frequency hsitogram with bin width 5 of data on left with left-most bin edge 35
		- sort it in bins, facecolor is the python boxes
	* types of modes:
		* Unimodal - one peak
		* BiModal - two peaks. distribution of ages at a childs birthday party. kids are one mode adults are another.
		* multimodal - more than two subpopualtions, more than two peak
	* skewness
		* leaning right its a negative skew
		* leaning lelft its a positive skew
		* none then its symmetrical

Box-whisker plot
	* Graphical representation of the 5 value summary
	* the box extends from Q1 to Q3
	* median line displays the meidan
	* whiskers extend to the fartherst data point within 1.5x IQR of each quartile. At most this is the fartherst it goes but it always ends on a point.
	* the fliers or outliers ar eany points outside of the whiskers
	* the width of the box is unimportant
	* can be horizontally or vertically oriented
