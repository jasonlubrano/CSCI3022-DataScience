    "Make a plot of the total number of Computer Science students versus the semester, with the most recent semester (Spring 2018) on the right and most distant past (Fall 2006) on the left. Label your axes. For the semester axis (the x-axis), label with the actual semester as a character string, like \"Fall 2006\" or \"Spring 2007\", for example. You may want to look up how to rotate the x-tick labels in order to make the semester name labels fit nicely. Comment on the results and any interesting trends or patterns you notice in Computer Science enrollment numbers."
